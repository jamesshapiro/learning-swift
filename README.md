# learning-swift

This directory is a record of the time I've spent learning the Swift programming language. The language-guide-experiments directory contains all of the tutorials included in the Swift Programming Language guide.

I have tried to expand on or personalize many of the examples by either experimenting to see what happens in cases not included in the tutorial, or by modifying the examples to involve my favorite football team (http://www.redskins.com).

I'm not sure how I will expand on this project, but I may include some of the things that I have learned from RayWenderlich.com on here.
